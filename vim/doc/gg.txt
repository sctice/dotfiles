==============================================================================
INTRODUCTION                                                              *gg*

This plugin is a front for the script 'gg', which itself wraps git-grep.
Git-grep can be used as a replacement for grep.  This plugin will allow you to
run gg from vim; it shows the results in a split window. It is a complete copy
of ack.vim, but it removes some functionality that doesn't apply to git-grep
and gg, and it changes some defaults.

:GG[!] [options] {pattern} [{directory}]                                 *:GG*

    Search recursively in {directory} (which defaults to the current
    directory) for the {pattern}.  Behaves just like the |:grep| command, but
    will open the |Quickfix| window for you. If [!] is not given the first
    occurence is jumped to.

:GGAdd [options] {pattern} [{directory}]                              *:GGAdd*

    Just like |:GG|, but instead of making a new list, the matches are
    appended to the current |quickfix| list.

:GGFromSearch [{directory}]                                    *:GGFromSearch*

    Just like |:GG| but the pattern is from previous search.

:LGG [options] {pattern} [{directory}]                                  *:LGG*

    Just like |:GG| but instead of the |quickfix| list, matches are placed in
    the current |location-list|.

:LGGAdd [options] {pattern} [{directory}]                            *:LGGAdd*

    Just like |:GGAdd| but instead of the |quickfix| list, matches are added
    to the current |location-list|

Files containing the search term will be listed in the split window, along
with the line number of the occurrence, once for each occurrence.  <Enter> on
a line in this window will open the file, and place the cursor on the matching
line.

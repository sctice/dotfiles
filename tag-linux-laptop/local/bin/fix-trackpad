# The trackpad on my galp5 becomes completely unresponsive from time to time. I
# don't know why. Running this script with, e.g.:
#
#   Alt+F2, then `fix-trackpad`
#
# should fix the issue (at least on the galp5). So far, I've tried the
# following to prevent the trackpad from freezing in the first place without
# success:
#
#  - Turn off "Touchpad: Disable While Typing"
#
# https://askubuntu.com/a/978159 did it for me.

pkexec modprobe -r hid_multitouch && sudo modprobe hid_multitouch

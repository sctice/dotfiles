# There is no "main" branch with git, but I often use a main-branch/feature-branch approach, and I
# have some aliases set up to conveniently show commits/diffs on a branch since it has diverged
# from the main branch. But some repositories use "main" as the "main" branch name and others use
# "master", which is git's default branch name, and those aliases need to know which branch on
# which to look for a point of divergence. We don't expect to have *both* "main" and "master", so
# we'll just use the first one that we see when listing all branches.

git branch --list | grep -E '^\*? +(main|master)$' | head -n 1 | tr -d ' *'
